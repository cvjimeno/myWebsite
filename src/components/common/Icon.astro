// src/components/common/Icon.astro (THE CORRECT WRAPPER COMPONENT)
import { Icon as AstroIcon } from 'astro-icon/components';

// This component acts as a "wrapper".
// It takes all the props you pass to <Icon ... /> (`name`, `class`, etc.)
// and passes them directly to the real Icon component from the astro-icon library.
